# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-Management
This project is a Facial Recognition-based Attendance Management System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MySQL. It automates the process of recording attendance by recognizing faces in real-time through a webcam feed. The system employs the face_recognition library to detect and recognize individuals and logs attendance into a MySQL database.
